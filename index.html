            <p>
              Growing up, I was always interested in computers and enjoyed playing around with them. I received my first device at 
              the age of 10, and it was a Kindle Fire tablet. This kickstarted my interest in messing around with technology, 
              and I began to change various aspects of it by installing a custom bootloader and custom ROMs. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This interest in technology continued
              to grow, and I ended up building a gaming computer when I was 14. Doing research on the various parts and their purpose
              within the machine made me much more interested in the topic of computers. It drove me to desire to create my own software
              and computer programs, which led me to learn Java independently in high school. This newfound knowledge allowed me to create
              my first mobile application as a sophomore in high school, which I was able to publish to the Google Play Store and monetize
              through advertisements. After watching this application quickly grow in downloads and gain positive reviews, my interest in 
              the field of computer science would only continue to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I entered college, I decided to pursue a degree in computer science because of this great interest in the field. I have
              had the pleasure of learning about many different topics in the field, including the theoretical and practical aspects of
              computer science. I have been able to delve deeper into specific topics such as databases, algorithms, data structures, and 
              data science in my coursework. Throughout my courses, I have worked on various projects which have strengthened my skills 
              and knowledge in the field. Yet, there remains so much to learn and explore, which is the beauty of the field. I am excited
              to continue to learn and grow in the field of computer science and to see where it takes me.

              <h4>September 2023 - December 2023</h4>
              <p>
                With a group of 4 students, we implemented a web application using a MySQL database and React that allows 
                users to input their travel preferences, including any budget constraints and temperature preferences. Given 
                these preferences, the web application generates appropriate trip itineraries for the user, including flights 
                and lodging, allowing the user to add the optimal ones to their user cart.

              <p>
                A fully-fledged operating system created in the C programming language. Contains different components
                including a shell, a file system, and a system scheduler. The system scheduler was implemented using a round
                robin scheduling algorithm. The various components were integrated into one final, fully operational operating
                system created in a group of 4 students.

              <h4>November 2023 - December 2023</h4>
              <p>
                A Jupyter Notebook that uses various modeling and exploratory data analysis techniques to analyze flight patterns
                and predict flight cancellations based on factors such as the date and time of the flight, the airline, and the
                origin and destination airports. The notebook was created in a group of 3 students and uses the libraries pandas,
                numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, TensorFlow, seaborn, and Plotly.

              <p>
                A compiler designed for a simple functional language called J. The compiler translates the J language code down to 
                ARM assembly code, which could then easily be assembled and run on the machine. The compiler was independently 
                created in a virtual machine and developed in the C programming language. An accompanying assembler and disassembler 
                tools were also created to allow for easy debugging of the compiler.

                Playable snake game independently created in the Java programming language. The game was created using the Java Swing
                library and features a simple GUI that allows users to play the game. Additionally, the game includes a high-score 
                system that tracks the user's highest score across sessions, storing it in the JAR executable.

              <h4>April 2022 - May 2022</h4>
              <p>
                A playable 2048 game designed independently in Java using the PennDraw library to provide a graphical interface. It 
                features a self-solver built on a heuristic scoring algorithm, which ranks possible moves and selects the best one 
                based on potential outcomes. The self-solver can be run with the game to optimally beat it, and the algorithm can also 
                provide hints to the user for the optimal move during normal gameplay.
